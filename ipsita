*Write a C++ program that will display if a students is pass or not in his exam.
(50% or more is pass). If the student is Pass than your program should display
which letter the student has obtained.
?? 85% or more E for excellent
?? 75% or more but less than 85% O for Outstanding
?? 65% or more but less than 75% G for good
?? Less than 65% S for satisfactory
If however the student is Fail (below 50% marks) your program should display 1
whether the student should Resit or Redo depending on the following criteria.
?? 33% or more Resit in exam
?? Less than 33% Redo course

Solution

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

int marks;

cout<<"enter marks "<<endl;

cin>>marks;

if(marks>=85)

{

cout<<"outstanding work "<<endl;

}

if(marks>=75 && marks<85)

{

cout<<"exellent work "<<endl;

}

if(marks>=65 && marks<75)

{

cout<<"average show "<<endl;

}

if(marks<=65 && marks>50)

{

cout<<"just/........ "<<endl;

}

if(marks<50 )
{

cout<<"bad show "<<endl;

if(marks<50 && (marks >=33))

{

cout<<"you can resit "<<endl;

}

else if(marks<33)

{

cout<<"redo please"<<endl;

}

}

}

Problem :2
Problem Statement – An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle
according to the given data below:

1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.

Example :
Input :
200 -> Value of V
540 -> Value of W
Output :
TW =130 FW=70

Explanation:
130+70 = 200 vehicles
(70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels

Constraints :
2<=W

W%2=0

V<W

Print “INVALID INPUT” , if inputs did not meet the constraints.

The input format for testing

The candidate has to write the code to accept two positive numbers separated by a new line.


First Input line – Accept value of V.

Second Input line- Accept value for W.

The output format for testing
Written program code should generate two outputs, each separated by a single space character(see the example)
Additional messages in the output will result in the failure of test case

Solution

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main () 
{
  int v, w;
  cin >> v >> w;
  float x = ((4 * v) - w) / 2;
  if ((w & 1) || w < 2 || w <= v)
    {
      cout << "INVALID INPUT";
      return 0;
    }
  cout << "TW=" << x << " " << "FW=" << v - x;

}
