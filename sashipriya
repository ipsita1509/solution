Program 1
The date July 10, 1970 is special because when we write it in the 7/10/70 format, the month times the day equals the year. Write a program that asks the user to enter a month
( in numeric form ), a day and a two digit year. The program should determine whether the month times the day is equal to the year.

(i) If so, it should display a message saying date is UNIQUE
(ii) Otherwise it should display a message saying the date is NOT UNIQUE


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){int day, month,year ,unique;
cout<<"Kindly input your date,month and year , i will tell you if your date is Unique"<<endl;
cout<<"\n Enter date , month , year that you wish for me to calculate for you "<<endl;
cin>> day >> month >> year;
unique = month*day;
if(month>0 && month<=12 && day>0 && day<=31 && year>=10 && year<=99)
{
if (unique == year){
cout<< "The date is UNIQUE"<<endl;
}
else{
cout<<"The date is NOT UNIQUE"<<endl;
}
}
else{
cout << "Enter valid month date and year "<<endl;
}
return 0;
}


Problem: 2

Write a C++ program in which user enter their CET and PUC marks and your program will help student in selection of University. Based on these marks student will be allocated a 
seat at different department of different University.University Name and Department CriteriaVTU UniversityIT:above 80% in CET and 70% in PUCComputer Science Eng : above 70% in
CET and 60% in PUCElectronics & comm : above 70% in CET and 50% in PUCManipal UniversityIT: 70%-60% in CET and 50% in PUCCivil Engg :59%-50% in CET and 50% in PUCMechanical 
Engg: Above 40% and below 50% in CET and 50% in PUC

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int cet;
int puc;
cout<<"please enter your cet marks "<<endl;
cin>>cet;
